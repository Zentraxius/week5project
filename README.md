#### By Cody Fritz

## Description

Tells the user how old they would be on various planets such as Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and tells them their expected lifespan on that planet by using the US average.

## Specifications (Specs)

User inputs age (Will use 25 for testing purposes, all rounded to nearest whole number)

1. On Earth you are age \* 1.00
2. On Mars you are age \* 1.88
3. On Venus you are age \* 0.62
4. On Jupiter you are age \* 11.86
5. On Mercury you are age \* .24

U.S average life expectancy is 78.6, will round up to 79 for convenience.

If user inputs their age, they will also get their life expectancy returned (on Earth, age 41, life expectancy 79, estimated remainder 38)

If user age is superior to life expectancy they will get a message detailing that (user inputs 90, life expectancy 79, congratulations you've been a cut above the rest for the past 11 years)
